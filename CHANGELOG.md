### Bug fixes

Fix a styling issue where the selection had become invisible inside snippet fields (when using `drawSelection`).

Snippet fields can now be selected with the pointing device (so that they are usable on touch devices).

## 0.17.3 (2021-01-18)

### Bug fixes

Fix a bug where uppercase completions would be incorrectly matched against the typed input.

## 0.17.2 (2021-01-12)

Don't bind Cmd-Space on macOS, since that already has a system default binding. Use Ctrl-Space for autocompletion.

### New features

The package now also exports a CommonJS module.

## 0.17.0 (2020-12-29)
